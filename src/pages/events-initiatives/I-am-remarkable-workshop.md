Have you ever felt super prepared when coming to a job interview but then become dead frozen when asked “What makes our company want to hire you, out of all candidates?”⁣
⁣
Have you ever questioned the significance of your achievements when compared to others’?⁣

Leave all the negative thoughts behind and remember that YOU are REMARKABLE the way YOU are! Learn how to self-promote by signing up for WiSC’s #IamRemarkable Workshop at the link in our bio.⁣

The main question to be discussed at the workshop is “𝘞𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘮𝘢𝘬𝘦𝘴 𝘠𝘖𝘜 𝘳𝘦𝘮𝘢𝘳𝘬𝘢𝘣𝘭𝘦?” Let’s take a look at some of our executives’ answers to this question. How about you? Have you got an answer for yourself? What makes YOU remarkable?⁣
