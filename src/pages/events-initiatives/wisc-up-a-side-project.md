Do you feel like you are wasting your first half of the year staying at home and doing nothing?⁣
Do you think your resume is not as remarkable as your fellows’ ones and desperately want to polish it with some noteworthy side projects?⁣
Do you simply want to pick up some new skills to “whisk up” your summer?⁣
⁣
WiSC is proudly presenting to you our very first project that will satisfy everything you need - Wiscing Up a Side Project (WUaSP). This program is aimed to give UTM students a chance to create a product that could benefit the society. Participants will be put into teams and work together on their own project until the end of this summer. Students of sciences and/or technology backgrounds are more than welcome to take part in this project.⁣

This program is not currently accepting applications, but stay on the loop in our social media for more opportunities!
