Our Cocoa and Cram event  has been postponed to Thursday March 31! Join us from 5-8pm in MN 1100, for a fun study session and a hot cup of cocoa, as well as popcorn and a movie to de-stress after! Come alone or with your study group, and get prepped for finals!

Can’t make it in person? Join our online session and get studying on zoom! Sign up with the links below, they’re also in our bio!

Please note that spaces are limited and the in-person event is first come first serve.
