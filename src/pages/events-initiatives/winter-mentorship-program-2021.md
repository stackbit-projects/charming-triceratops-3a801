Weâ€™re excited to reintroduce the Mentorship Program! Here's the opportunity for first year students  as well as for third and fourth year students to learn and grow through a mentor-mentee relationship with upper year students and industry professionals, respectively. The Mentorship Program is also looking for upper year student mentors looking to support incoming first year students! These opportunities are available to all female identifying students and minority groups!  

All mentees work with an assigned mentor, to gain personalized, one-on-one experience! Mentors and mentees will be matched based on skill set, and program, and career interests.
