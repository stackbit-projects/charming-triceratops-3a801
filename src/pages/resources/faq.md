          WiSC aims to hold events that have purpose. Each of our events can be

          guest appearances. As a result, we host technical workshops,
          networking and recruitment events, community engagement events,
          destressors, and so much more!

        content: >
          We abide by the University of Toronto’s guidelines for in-person
          gatherings in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. If we do host any
          in-person events, they will be hybrid events, meaning they will be
          accessible online as well as in-person.
