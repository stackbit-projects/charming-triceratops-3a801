          When I'm not stressing about school, I like to read, paint, and watch
          Netflix :). I also really enjoy experimenting with different forms of
          art: a few months ago it was embroidery, right now it's sewing! This
          year, I hope WiSC is able to create a tight-knit community, both
          online and on-campus, for women-identifying students!

          Apart from studying and school, I love nature and going on adventures
          with my friends and family. I also love fashion and makeup, and you'll
          likely find me online shopping in my spare time :') This year, I would
          love to see WiSC hosting initiatives that bring together the entire
          community within these unprecedented times.

          read a nice book! I would love to see more science students get

          I love going out and exploring new places, locally and abroad! So far,
          I've been to 8 countries and can't wait to visit more :) I hope to see
          WiSC expand more into the sciences and provide research/internship
          opportunities for them!

          look forward to building a strong community of women who share the
          same passions as me as we navigate the STEM field!

          Over the pandemic I've picked up plants as a hobby - carnivorous
          plants and cacti in particular! I I also love to draw and paint in my
          spare time! This year, I'd love to see WiSC's mentorship programs
          attract more students and mentors alike.

          Fun fact 1: It's my last year (hopefully) at UTM, my second year at
          WiSC, and my first year being the Director of First Year Associates.
          Fun fact 2: The correct pronunciation of my name is "eye-ing" but i
          don't mind people mispronouncing it anyways I would love to see us
          WiSC up the initiatives that could not be implemented in the past
          years and more initiatives to come!

          I am an avid writer, and have produced a self-authored play, and
          published some short stories and poems. I am super keen on
          understanding how communications and interactions between people can
          be improved. For this year, I would like our team to promote and
          advertise more collaborative events that allow students to increase
          their competencies through team-work driven projects.

          I absolutely love listening to music (I'm a huge Harry Styles fan!)
          and reading novels. I also enjoy travelling and writing, and
          occasionally try my hand at cooking as well! I hope that this year,
          WiSC is able to empower as many students as possible to dream big and
          aim high!

          I like playing the Sims and can guess any Taylor Swift song from the
          first 3 seconds! I'd love to see WiSC organize a fundraising event for
          charities that are addressing educational equality and promoting women
          in STEM.

          I play badminton and I'm also trying to pick up bass guitar recently.
          I'd love to be part of WiSC and help build the community :D

          I’ve been playing golf since I was 8! And I’m double jointed:) I’d
          like for the WiSC to create a sense of community through
          online/in-person events, so that students can feel better supported in
          achieving their goals. (And I hope to optimize the budget so that we
          won’t go broke doing it :))
